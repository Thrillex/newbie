<h1>First GIThub Page</h1>

<p>There is a lot of talk about who will be the new president. There are four reasons why I dont care.</p>
<ol>
  <li>I am going to be successful regardless of who is the president.</li>
  <li>My son is gifted so he will do well also.</li>
  <li>My wife has a doctorate degree, is very smart and responsible.</li>
  <li>I can move to another country
</ol> 

<p>Ted Williams, also know as Thrillex once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life is sometimes like skiing; you learn the most going downhill.</p>
<p>You dont learn anything on the ride up and you dont learn anything standing still at the top. If you keep your wits about you and pay attention to what is happening every time you go down the hill you become better at avoiding falls.</p>
